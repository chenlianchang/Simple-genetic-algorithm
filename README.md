Simple-genetic-algorithm
========================

A simple genetic algorithm, and via one example test it.

The programe is demonstration via simple example:
y = (x-10)**2
we want to get the min y.
notice: 0<=x<=64.

ga_early.py:
It is a simple example, it is no entropy, so is convergenced very early.

ga_entropy.py:
It add entropy, so is conergenced later as ga_early.

run:
python ga_early.py
python ga_entropy.py

If you run the programe, it generate a new file is ga_data.txt, and you can see the data of generate by genetic-algorithm.
